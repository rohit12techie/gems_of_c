In Linux, we all know bash shell, it's an interpreter which accepts the system commands and gives the result as output or error. What if you want to create your own shell and your own commands to run on that shell.

The new shell name will be rshell and it will have few internal commands like help, version, about and exit. Rest all the system command will be supported in this shell. 

Currently, all the system commands are not supported and command with pipe and redirection not supported.
